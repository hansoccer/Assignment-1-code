README — Assignment 1 (Victoria Daily Electricity Demand Forecasting)

Project: Predicting Victoria’s Daily Electricity Demand (2015–2020)

Student: Yiming Li (a1948774)

Artifact: Assignment 1 code.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)

1. What this project does

This notebook builds an operational day-ahead forecaster for Victoria’s daily electricity demand using 2015–2020 data. It:
- loads and cleans daily demand/price, weather, and calendar data;

- engineers leakage-safe lag/rolling and seasonal features;

- trains and evaluates three models (Seasonal-Naïve, Ridge, LightGBM);

- prints test metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) and saves figures (fit, residuals, feature importance, PV trend).

2. Recommended folder layout

Assignment/
Assignment 1 code.ipynb
data/
complete_dataset.csv
sgu-solar-installations-2011-to-present.csv
outputs/ (generated by the notebook: figures, tables)

3. Software requirements

Operating system: Windows 11 (tested). macOS or Linux are fine with equivalent commands.
Python: 3.10–3.12 (Anaconda or Miniconda recommended).
Python packages: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyterlab.

4. Environment setup (Windows 11, PowerShell)

A. Create and activate a clean environment (Conda)
i. conda create -n vic-demand python=3.11 -y
ii. conda activate vic-demand
iii. python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
iiii. pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn lightgbm matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab

If LightGBM fails to install with pip on Windows:
- Try: conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm

- Ensure recent Microsoft C++ build tools are available (usually not needed because wheels exist).

B. Launch Jupyter
i. In PowerShell, cd to the folder containing “Assignment 1 code.ipynb”.
ii. Run: jupyter lab
iii. Open “Assignment 1 code.ipynb”.

5. Data placement

Place the following files in the “data” folder (or adjust paths in the notebook):
- data/complete_dataset.csv (Victoria daily demand + weather + RRP + calendar, 2015–2020)

- data/sgu-solar-installations-2011-to-present.csv (postcode-level PV installs, 2011–present)

6. How to run

i.Open the notebook in JupyterLab.
ii.Check the first cell titled Paths/Config. If your data files are not under ./data/, change the paths.
iii.Run all cells in order:
- JupyterLab menu: Run -> Run All Cells, or Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells.
iiii. On completion you should see:
- Console output: data audit (rows, date range, dtypes), imputation log, train/test split, test metrics for Seasonal-Naïve, Ridge, and LightGBM.

- Saved figures written to ./outputs/ (or alongside the notebook if the outputs folder does not exist): true vs predicted overlay, parity (scatter), residual time trace, residual histogram, feature importance, Victoria PV monthly and cumulative trend.

7. Reproducibility notes

Random seeds are fixed (e.g., random_state=42). Small numerical differences can occur with LightGBM due to multithreading but do not affect conclusions.

The evaluation uses a strict temporal split (2015–2019 training/validation, 2020 test). Do not shuffle across time; shuffling would make metrics optimistic.

8. Common issues and fixes

A. LightGBM installation on Windows:

- Prefer: conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm

- If using pip: upgrade pip/setuptools/wheel first.

B. Pandas “chained assignment” FutureWarning:

The warning does not change results. To silence only that message, insert:
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore",
message=".A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series.",
category=FutureWarning)

C. Scikit-learn RMSE FutureWarning (squared deprecated):

- Option 1: from sklearn.metrics import root_mean_squared_error
rmse = root_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)

- Option 2: suppress FutureWarning only for sklearn.metrics._regression.

D. File not found:

- Ensure the CSV paths in the first cell match your local layout. Paths are case-sensitive on macOS/Linux.
